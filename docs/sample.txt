**Issue: Unable to Connect to the Network**

**Symptoms:**
- Users are reporting an inability to connect to the company network.
- Error messages such as "No Internet Connection" or "Limited Connectivity" are displayed.

**Possible Causes:**
1. **Network Configuration Issues:**
   - Verify that the device has the correct network settings (IP address, subnet mask, gateway).
   - Check if the device is configured to obtain an IP address automatically (DHCP).

2. **Hardware Problems:**
   - Inspect physical connections (Ethernet cables, Wi-Fi adapters) for damage.
   - Ensure that routers, switches, and other networking equipment are powered on and functioning.

3. **Firewall or Antivirus Software:**
   - Temporary disable firewall or antivirus software to check if they are blocking the network connection.

4. **DNS Issues:**
   - Check the DNS settings on the device. Use a public DNS server like Google DNS (8.8.8.8) to test.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

1. **Check Physical Connections:**
   - Ensure all cables are securely connected.
   - If using Wi-Fi, ensure the device is within range of the router.

2. **Restart Networking Equipment:**
   - Power cycle routers, switches, and modems.
   - Restart the device experiencing connectivity issues.

3. **Verify Network Settings:**
   - Check the IP configuration on the device.
   - If using DHCP, ensure the router is assigning IP addresses correctly.

4. **Disable Firewall/Antivirus:**
   - Temporarily disable firewall or antivirus software.
   - Check if the issue persists. If it resolves, reconfigure the software settings.

5. **DNS Configuration:**
   - Verify DNS settings on the device.
   - Test with a different DNS server to rule out DNS issues.

6. **Check for System Updates:**
   - Ensure the operating system and network drivers are up-to-date.

**Additional Resources:**
- For detailed instructions on configuring network settings, refer to the user manual for your device.
- Consult the IT department for assistance if the issue persists.
